            <br>First a fun weekend project, We're Official quickly evolved into an established business. In under a year and a half it became a popular option for announcing a wedding. It's following on social media grew to nearly 3000 and provides a decent library of preferred photographers. It offers products like wedding websites, printed announcements, and thank you cards as well as a free solution for couples to collect guest addresses. From all designs to the web development on top of managing clients and partner relationships Iâ€™ve learned a lot about the ins and outs of running a business.</p>

With a Project Manager we created all packaging and in store displays for many big retailers across the nation. My desire to get more into digital became a reality and I quickly became involved in their web presence. I was the sole designer responsible for a major redesign of a number of their websites including lifetime.com and the company intranet.</p>
