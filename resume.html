            <p>At MX I've been privileged to take on multiple projects across a variety of departments. My first task was to guide and direct clients on how to brand, market and launch our white labeled products. I was an integral part of the complete rebrand from MoneyDesktop to MX leading charge on logo design and web design efforts. Currently, my focus is on improving our digital product experiences.</p>

            <p>First a fun weekend project, We're Official quickly evolved into an established business. In under a year and a half it became a popular option for announcing a wedding. It's following on social media grew to nearly 3000 and provides a decent library of preferred photographers. It offers products like wedding websites, printed announcements, and thank you cards as well as a free solution for couples to collect guest addresses. From all designs to the web development on top of managing clients and partner relationships I’ve learned a lot about the ins and outs of running a business.</p>

            <p>I took my print foundation and applied it to marketing and sales materials associated with Lifetime's Lawn &amp; Garden product line. With a Project Manager we created all packaging and in store displays for many big retailers across the nation. My desire to get more into digital became a reality and I quickly became involved in their web presence. I was the sole designer responsible for a major redesign of a number of their websites including lifetime.com and the company intranet.</p>

I was responsible for all pre-press, digital print jobs and various post press operations such as cutting, folding, scoring, binding, and packaging. Besides the expansive understanding of paper and the productions involved in various print projects, I was the point of contact for large companies and learned skills to manage those relationships.</p>
