        <h1>Room For All in His Inn</h1>
        <p><strong>Place:</strong> Traverse Mountain 1st Ward, Sacrament Meeting

      <p>Recently I learned a interesting fact about zebras and ostriches. Through observing these two very different species they’ve discovered that ostriches and zebras often team up together in packs. What's even more interesting is the specific reason why they choose each other. It turns out zebras have excellent eyesight but not a great sense of smell. Ostriches, on the other hand, have an amazing sense of smell but not-so-great eyesight. Because of this they often travel together and warn each other when danger is coming. Each animal benefits from the strength of the other animal and this relationship keeps them safe from falling prey to other animals.</p>

      <p>I’ve been able to learn from this example and liken it to things I’ve been experiencing and recent topics that I’ve found myself pondering over.</p>

      <p>Within the church, there is often this pressure that we feel we need to be perfect. That we need to know everything, have a strong opinion on every topic, or have a strong testimony about each facet of the gospel. I think our devices and social media over the years have seemed to heighten this aspiration to check all the boxes and always be performing at a certain level.</p>

      <p>I think we are becoming more aware of the impacts this has on us individually but this can also have a polarizing effect on our ability to come together, truly unite, and experience certain necessary things that we just can’t experience on our own.</p>

      <p>Zebras and ostriches are great examples to us on how critical our weaknesses, strengths, and differences are in the scheme of things. In their case, it’s what actually brings them together and some days may even mean the difference between life and death.</p>

      <p>This year’s theme for our stake is “Room for all in His Inn.” I’d like to highight three things that I think might help us come together and live up to this theme this year, those three things are:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>- Empathy</strong></li>
      <li><strong>- Vulnerability</strong></li>
      <li><strong>- Hospitality</strong></li>
      </ul>
      </p>


      <p class="transition">Empathy</p>

      <p>To help illustrate the meaning of empathy I’d like to tell you a little about what I do for work.</p>

      <p>I’m a designer. I design digital product experiences, like software, mobile apps, or websites. Designing these types of experiences often takes a bit of trial and error. It’s even been described as a never ending process because digital products can always get better or be improved. A decent amount of my time is spent on research. I often will sit down with people who use the product that I’m working on and ask them a lot of questions. Another research method that I really like is where I actually just watch them use the product. Sometimes I’ll ask them to complete a list of tasks and just observe how they do it. Watching someone struggle to do something or find delight accomplishing a task can be really insightful. Sometimes I’ll even record these sessions so I can rewatch and try to understand even more. It allows me to kind of walk in their shoes  it helps me better understand how they experience things and even how they’re feeling while they do it.</p>

      <p>So to acquire more empathy for one another we may need to put more time into trying to understand one another. As we understand each other on a deeper level I think it becomes easier to:

      <ul>
      <li>- Be more patient of one another,</li>
      <li>- Be more aware of each other’s needs,</li>
      <li>- Be slower to anger or judge one another.</li>
      <li>- Become more trusting.</li>
      <li>- Look more for the good in one another.</li>
      <li>- Start to see each other as what we each can become.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>In the Book of Mormon we read that in order to come into the fold of God and to be called His people, we must be:
      <br><em>“willing to bear one another’s burdens, and mourn with those that mourn…”</em></p>

      <p>It doesn’t say “lift one another’s burdens” or, “make happy those that mourn”. It says we need to experience other people’s burdens and mournings with them. We need to obtain empathy for what they are going through. It’s then that we are able to really “comfort those that stand in need of comfort.”</p>

      <p>My work example and this example from the scriptures show that it’s difficult to obtain empathy all by yourself, it kind of requires someone to open up and share their burdens or the feelings they are going through — it requires vulnerability.</p>

      <p class="transition">Vulnerability</p>

      <p>Vulnerability is tough, it takes a lot of courage and can at times make us feel quite uncomfortable.</p>

      <p>There is a Doctor of Philosophy by the name of Brene Brown. She has spent a lot of her life’s work researching our thoughts, and feelings, and building deeper connections with each other. She has a lot of great insights on the topic of being vulnerable — there is one where she says:
      <br><em>“Owning our story can be hard but not nearly as difficult as spending our lives running from it. Embracing our vulnerabilities is risky but not nearly as dangerous as giving up on love and belonging and joy—the experiences that make us the most vulnerable.”</em></p>

      <p>Brene has a lot of great conversations with prolific people about this topic, in a conversation she had with Oprah, Oprah explains what vulnerability is quite powerfully, she said:
      <br><em>“It is being willing to express the truth no matter what — the truth of who you are. The essence at the core of what you are feeling at any given moment. Being able to open up your soul and let it flow so that other people can see their soul in yours.”</em></p>

      <p>It’s good to remember that despite our current differences, one thing we always share in common is that our souls are all on a journey. Our journeys all start out in different places and they look very different from each other. We talk often about the straight and narrow path — I’ve come to think of it being referred to as such because it serves as a constant but I don’t think it is expected of us to constantly feel like we are always walking on it.</p>

      <p>I love how Elder Uchtdorf helped normalize this a bit this past conference, he said things like:
      <br><em>“We are all wanderers... we do forget, all the time... We deviate... We walk in circles... We struggle to walk straight ahead because of our uncertainty of where straight ahead is... We may not even realize when we veer off course... No matter how strong our spiritual experiences have been in the past.”</em></p>

      <p>Embracing the fact that straight ahead feels like a different direction to all of us, that we are all wandering, we are all imperfect, and then being vulnerable about it is not only how we allow others into our lives but how we more fully allow Christ into our lives as well.</p>

      <p>The apostle Paul, in his second epistle to the Corinthians teaches:
      <br><em>“My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore, I take pleasure in weaknesses… For when I am weak, then am I strong.”</em></p>

      <p>Our vulnerability should never come as a sign of weakness for this very reason that Paul teaches, it is through our weaknesses that we find strength in Christ. Without being vulnerable about our weaknesses we can’t truly come to know our Savior or each other.</p>

      <p>I think a big reason we are so afraid of being vulnerable is because we don’t know how we will be accepted. That being said, we are much more open to sharing our true feelings when we feel we are in a safe space or when we feel a sense of hospitality.</p>

      <p class="transition">Hospitality</p>

      <p>When I think about hospitality I envision this setting in my mind where I’m visiting some friends or family and it's clear they have spent a lot of time and effort preparing for my visit. There is a pitcher of fresh lemonade sitting on a fancy doily and next to it is some type of tiered cake stand that has sandwiches hand cut into triangles. As I look around it’s obvious the home was just cleaned - there are vacuum marks in the carpet and it smells a little like windex.</p>

      <p>Speaking biblically, hospitality is a lot more than that. It’s more about treating strangers and friends alike. It is welcoming not only friend but stranger into our homes but more so into our lives.</p>

      <p>The people of Israel received precise instruction on this subject, in the book of Leviticus it reads:
      <br><em>“But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.”</em></p>

      <p>The theme of “Room for all in His Inn” was inspired by the lesson we read where Christ was teaching about how we should, “love thy neighbor as thyself”. Present at the time of this lesson, was a lawyer who of all people knew there were strict rules regarding association between Samaritans and Jews so he asked for clarification, “who is my neighbor?”</p>

      <p>To answer this Christ shared the parable of the Good Samaritan. Who despite their deepest differences and at risk for being criticized not only stopped to help someone in need but carried this person to an inn, made room for them, and did all they could to lift, heal, and make them better.</p>

      <p>In many definitions of the word, the Jew was not this Samaritan’s neighbor. Christ made it clear that we are all neighbors and the compassion and love that we often extend to our closest of friends should always also be extended to those that feel stranger to us.</p>

      <p>There are times where we may find ourselves in situations where we feel like this Jew. Where we long for someone to come to us and make us feel seen. We have an innate desire to be loved, we all want to feel welcomed, or feel like we belong.</p>

      <p>Brene Brown, in one of her talks said that we often mistake belonging for fitting in. In fact she mentions that through her research she’s found fitting in to be the opposite of belonging. She explains that in order to fit in we tend to acclimate to our surroundings; we figure out what it is we should say and what we should avoid saying, we figure out how we should dress and what we should look like all for the sake of fitting in. True belonging, she says though, should not require you to CHANGE who you are but actually require you to BE who you are.</p>

      <p>It doesn’t matter if we are Jew or Samaritan, or metaphorically speaking, a zebra or an ostrich… in this Church, we believe in the divine potential of all of God’s children and in our ability to become something more in Christ, together. God made us all beautifully different. The church is amazing because there are so many opportunities for us to be vulnerable and obtain empathy for one another. As we do I believe our capacity to highlight our differences and compliment each other will grow. Our meetings, our activities, and our conversations will feel different and they will be hospitable places where there is not only room for all but places where all feel needed and all feel like they belong.</p>
