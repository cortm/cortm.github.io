              <h1>MX Mobile Banking</h1>
              <p>Almost nothing impacts our lives more than our finances, yet the tools available for managing them don’t live up to their potential. MX’s mobile app aims to bring user’s entire financial pictures into one place and present their data in visually engaging ways and serve them hyper-personalized offers and insights to better their financial understanding and situation.</p>
              <p>MX believes if it can solve individual’s financial problems, it will in turn help families, communities, and nations.</p>

        <h2>My Role at MX</h2>
        <p>In November 2012, I joined MX excited to help solve big problems and build the future of banking. 2 years later I was tasked with leading the Product Design team with a primary focus to improve the mobile experiences. At the time, the applications were just about to get their prime-time debut with our biggest client yet, the fourth largest credit union in the country. This client’s existing mobile app, used by over a million users, was being replaced with MX’s white labeled product. Frankly, it had yet to go through much testing and had lacked necessary design attention. Below are some of the problems I realized early on and some of the solutions I created to solve them.</p>

      <section class="case">
        <p class="title-helper">Problem</p>
        <h2>Sand in the Engine</h2>
        <p>Multiple engineers had sped to meet a deadline, building out views unaware of what each other were working on. This led to an overwhelming amount of inconsistencies in the UI. Small even subtle inconsistencies are like sand in the engine of an automobile. If my car can’t get me smoothly from point A to B, my frustration can be insurmountable. If a user can’t complete a task smoothly, they’ll be faced with similar feelings. Especially when that task is checking an account balance to make an emergency purchase or paying an electric bill so their power doesn’t get shut off.</p>
        <p>Before I could get to solving big problems for our users, the state of the experience from a UI standpoint had to be evaluated. We took inventory of every view in the app and by doing, could identify grains of sand and fix inconsistencies at a global level.</p>

        <p class="title-helper">Solution</p>
        <h2>Setting a Foundation</h2>
        <p>Grouping views that had similar components (buttons, modals, lists etc.) allowed me to take each instance into consideration when improving upon that component. Breaking apart the interface into smaller reusable pieces really helped our teams understand the construction of our products.</p>
        <p>The benefits of a well thought-out, living set of design standards brought tremendous value. It created a platform to discuss design decisions and promoted collaboration across multiple disciplines throughout many of our processes. It made code and design assets much more maintainable which meant onboarding new designers and developers could be much simpler. It also allowed us to spend less time on pixel perfect mockups and spend more time prototyping, testing, and iterating.</p>

        <p class="title-helper">Problem</p>
        <h2>A Perception of Complexity</h2>
        <p>One of my biggest problems about the product at this point was the main dashboard, the very first thing the user sees when they log in. Up to this point, the phone and tablet apps had the same features but worked off two separate codebases. The apps are very feature-rich: an accounts feature that shows account details and balances, another to see all transactions, a tool to visualize spending by category, interactive budgets, a detailed net worth chart, just to name a few. A summarized version of each feature was displayed on the dashboard in a columnar layout and was the only form of navigation. Needless to say, users often felt overwhelmed by the complex nature of this view, getting users to manage their money is hard enough as it is. We needed to flip the user's perception, and killing features wasn't an option.</p>
        <p>Another issue here was the layout just wouldn't scale. Adding additional features or necessary links for clients was an exhausting task; What size should it be? Where should it fit? How does that affect the layout on different devices? All of this had to be solved, and quickly.</p>

      <section class="case">
        <p class="title-helper">Solution</p>
        <h2>Simplicity through Familiarity</h2>
        <p>Great interfaces don't leave the user clueless, they should be simple and use design patterns and interactions users are familiar with. I came up with a simple set of guidelines for how a dashboard feature card should look and act on the dashboard.</p>
        <p>At each stage of life we find ourselves in different financial situations, very rarely are two people’s the same. Because of this, we had often talked about the idea of allowing the user to customize their experience by hiding or showing and reordering feature cards on the dashboard. My new design aimed to solve this as well. On top of that, I was suggesting a completely new experience for tablet devices, which would allow us to consolidate the two codebases into one. This had a huge impact across the board. It cut our design time almost in half, it meant thousands of lines of code less to manage, and made navigating the app much simpler for users. Win, win, win.</p>

        <p class="title-helper">Outcome</p>
        <h2>More Focus on the User</h2>
        <p>The new layout and design system solved the easy problems. We could now focus on bigger problems the product was actually trying to solve. We could devote more time and focus on the user. Through increased usability testing, soliciting more user feedback, and being able to ship updates more frequently, we’ve been able to really improve the mobile banking experience for our users.</p>

        <p class="intro">Back to the car analogy... I rarely take notice of the status of my car when it gets me safely to my destination. I don't thank it for not breaking down, I expect it not to. Users more than ever expect clean, smooth, sand-free experiences when using apps on their devices. But when you're able to make significant improvements consistently, the user is delighted and DOES start to notice. In less than a year there were many results that surfaced because of these improvements, here are a few:</p>
