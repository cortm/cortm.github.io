        <h1>Making Sense of Crash Data</h1>

        <p class="primer">About Numetric</p>
        <div class="company-intro">
          <p class="ci-side content">A few civil engineers at the Utah Department of Transportation recognized that turning data into decisions was cumbersome and time-consuming. They figured an automation-driven approach could fix this problem. It could enable anyone — regardless of skill level — to perform data-driven safety analysis. With that realization, Numetric was born.<p class="ci-side content">One of the first tools they created was an application called Crash Query which allowed people to explore crash data in a more familiar dashboard-like interface. The first version of Crash Query was a big step forward for safety professionals and began to uncover an underserved market that could benefit greatly from some well-designed software.</p>

      <div class="study-section lg">
        <p class="primer">Understanding Through Discovery</p>
        <p class="content">I’m a firm believer that a well designed product is only as good as the discovery and user understanding that goes into it. I had almost zero knowledge about traffic safety prior to joining Numetric. Our Product Manager and I realized quickly that in order to design a useful product we had to dive in and understand the users, their needs, and their processes.</p>
        <p class="content">After extensive research of white papers, documented workflows, and several conversations with safety professionals from DOTs (Dept. of Transportation) across the U.S. we began to understand which of their current problems could be solved within our product. We also began to realize some of the pain points within the Crash Query app were closely tied with some of the features we had began to ideate on based on our findings.</p>
        <p class="content">These findings led to prioritization of product improvements that ultimately resulted in a completely new Crash Query application.</p>

        <p class="primer">Identifying Problems & Creating Solutions</p>
        <p class="content">Below are a few examples of some of the initial paint points <strong>(on the left)</strong> that emerged in our research. Next to the pain points are features <strong>(on the right)</strong> we built after rounds of prototyping and usability testing.</p>

        <div class="col">
          <p class="title"><span class="ba-label">Before</span> i. Cumbersome implementation process</p>
          <p>Our CX Team would have to determine which metrics the customer wanted their users to track. Due to its subjective nature this process could take days and even then the chosen metrics fell short for some users.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <p class="title"><span class="ba-label">After</span> i. Configurations available to end users</p>
          <p>We were able to drastically decrease the time it takes to implement new customers while empowering all users to easily pick whatever metrics are important to them (and even vary by project).</p>

        <div class="col">
          <p class="title"><span class="ba-label">Before</span> ii. Unreadable, inaccessible charts</p>
          <p>The charting library we used at the time did not respond or perform well under the constraints we were imposing on it and accessibility of these charts suffered greatly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <p class="title"><span class="ba-label">After</span> ii. Invention of a new chart type</p>
          <p>Instead of attempting to bank on another third party charting library I set out to solve this issue in a different way by creating an all new data visualization.</p>

        <div class="col">
          <p class="title"><span class="ba-label">Before</span> iii. Overwhelming visuals</p>
          <p>A multi-column layout of metrics with varying colors made it difficult for anyone especially new visitors to get familiar with the tool without feeling overwhelmed by all the data displayed at once.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <p class="title"><span class="ba-label">After</span> iii. Simplified layout and added context</p>
          <p>Because we were able to simplify how we displayed data we were able to in-turn consolidate two tabs of functionality into one. This proved to offer users additional context in their analysis.</p>

        <div class="col">
          <p class="title"><span class="ba-label">Before</span> iv. Gaps in processes</p>
          <p>Having access to all this data was nice but there was a big need for users to export or share their studies. We were forcing our users out of our apps in order to complete their work. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <p class="title"><span class="ba-label">After</span> iv. Always offer an output</p>
          <p>Contextual inquiry type interviews led to uncovering a similarity for a majority of our users. We filled a major gap allowing users to create a proffessional report with just a few clicks.</p>

      <div class="outcome">
        <p class="primer">Outcomes Over Outputs</p>
        <p class="content">I find tremendous joy in designing and building products. Beyond that though, the cherry on top is hearing how the tools you build make a difference in other people's lives. Since we first began researching how to improve processes for traffic safety professionals we have seen a <strong>700% increase in customer growth</strong> (as of July 2020) and now <strong>power AASHTOWare's Safety Platform</strong> (one of the most trusted organizations in traffic safety).</p>
        <p class="content">This is not the end of the road (pun intended), however. Another part of product design I love so much is it never ends... there is always room to iterate and improve.</p>
