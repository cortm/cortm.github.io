              <h1>MX Mobile Banking</h1>
              <p>Almost nothing impacts our lives more than our finances, yet the tools available for managing them don’t live up to their potential. MX’s mobile app aims to bring user’s entire financial pictures into one place and present their data in visually engaging ways as well as offer them hyper-personalized offers and insights to better their financial understanding and situation.</p>
              <p>MX believes if it can solve individual’s financial problems, it will in turn help families, communities, and nations.</p>

        <h2>My Role at MX</h2>
        <p>In November 2012, I joined MX excited to help solve big problems and build the future of banking. 2 years later I was tasked with leading the Product Design team (of 3) with my primary focus being to improve the mobile application. At the time, it was just about to get it's prime-time debut with our biggest client yet, the fourth largest credit union in the country. This client’s existing app, used by over a million users, was being replaced with MX’s white labeled experience. Frankly, the app had yet to go through much testing and had lacked necessary design attention. Below are some of the problems I realized early on and some of the solutions I created to solve them.</p>

      <section class="case">
        <p class="title-helper">Problem #1</p>
        <h2>Sand in an engine</h2>
        <p>Multiple engineers had sped to meet a deadline, building out views unaware of what each other were working on. This led to an overwhelming amount of inconsistencies in the UI. Small even subtle inconsistencies are like sand in an engine. If my car can’t get me smoothly from point A to B, my frustration can be insurmountable. If a user can’t complete a task smoothly, they’ll be faced with similar feelings. Especially when that task is checking an account balance to make an emergency purchase or paying an electric bill so their power doesn’t get shutoff.</p>
        <p>Before I could get to solving big problems for our users the state of the experience from a UI standpoint had to be evaluated. We took inventory of every view in the app and by doing so could remove grains of sand and fix inconsistencies at a global level.</p>

      <section class="case">
        <p class="title-helper">Solution</p>
        <h2>Pieces to the puzzle</h2>
        <p>The solution was a well-thoughtout pattern library of reusable UI components. The benefits of creating a living set of design standards instead of zeroing in on each individual screen as had been done in the past, brought tremendous value. It created a platform to discuss design decisions and promoted collaboration across multiple departments throughout our entire process. It made code and design assets much more maintainable which meant onboarding new designers and developers could be much simpler. It also allowed us to spend less time on “pixel perfect” mockups and spend more time prototyping, testing, and iterating.</p>

      <section class="case">
        <p class="title-helper">Problem #2</p>
        <h2>Structure/Organization</h2>
        <p>Designing the system solved the easy problems. We could now focus on bigger problems the product was actually trying to solve. One of my biggest gripes about the product at this point was the main dashboard, the first thing the user sees when they log in. Up to this point phones and tablets had the same features but worked off two separate codebases by design. The apps are very feature rich, an accounts feature that shows account details and balances, another to see all transactions that have occurred, a tool to visualize spending by category, interactive budgets, and a detailed net worth chart, just to name a few. A summarized version of each feature was displayed on the dashboard in a columnar layout and was the only form of navigation.</p>
        <p>The biggest issue here was it would not scale. Adding additional features for clients was an exhausting task - What size should it be? Where should it fit? How does that affect the layout on different devices? </p>

      <section class="case">
        <p class="title-helper">Solution</p>
        <h2>Pieces to the Puzzle</h2>
        <p>The solution was a simple set of guidelines for how a feature card could look, act, and work on the dashboard. At each stage of life we find ourselves in different financial situations, very rarely are two people’s the same. We had often talked about the idea of allowing the user to customize their experience by hiding or showing and reordering features on the dashboard. My new design aimed to solve this as well. On top of that, I was suggesting a completely new experience on a tablet that would allow us to consolidate the two codebases into one. This had big impact across the board. It meant less to account for when designing, thousands of lines of code less to manage, and made navigating the app much simpler. Win, win, win.</p>

      <section class="case">
        <p class="title-helper">All else will follow</p>
        <h2>More focus on the user</h2>
        <p>This new dashboard layout and guidelines and the design system solved the easy problems. We could now focus on bigger problems the product was actually trying to solve. We could devote more time and focus on the user. Through increased usability testing, soliciting more user feedback and being able to send updates more frequently we’ve been able to really improve the mobile banking experience for our users.</p>
