              <h1>Names &amp; Faces</h1>
              <p>Remembering names has been hard for me in the past so I took on the challenge of designing an experience that would help solve this problem, specifically directed at educators to learn their students' names more quickly.</p>
              <p>For this design exercise, I spent a little over 11 hours. That included the steps as they are described below as well as creating this web page. It was really fun to go through and I hope you find it interesting.</p>

        <h2>Defining the Problem &amp; Goal</h2>
        <p>First, I like to really wrap my head around exactly what it is I’m designing. I'm constantly asking, “why?” Design should have a purpose. For me, it’s really just about solving a bunch of problems. Defining the problem(s) clearly and concisely is vital to creating the right solution.</p>
        <p>It is equally important to understand what the desired outcome is. What value comes from solving this problem? What are the goals? What does success look like and how will it be measured? This allows me to gauge how effective my solution becomes. Knowing this, also makes it easier for me to imagine what failure will look like. Trying to predict what potential obstacles may arise can help me pivot more quickly when they do or avoid them altogether. Here are the problem and goal for this exercise:</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> At the beginning of each new semester or school year, teachers are faced with the challenge of remembering names for a large number of new students.</p>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Design an experience to help an educator match faces to names, with the outcome of shortening the time needed to reach complete un-aided accuracy.</p>

      <section class="case">
        <p class="title-helper">Step 2</p>
        <h2>Understanding the User</h2>
        <p>There’s not a better way to understand the problem you’re trying to solve than by talking to those who are experiencing it. In order to collect the most data in the quickest amount of time, I created a simple survey and shared it directly with anyone I knew that is currently or has been in some type of educating role.</p>
        <p>Here are some questions I asked:
        <br>• What grade do you teach?
        <br>• Why is learning each of your student’s names important to you?
        <br>• For you personally, how difficult would you say it is to learn the names of your students?
        <br>• About how long would you say it takes you to learn all your students' names?
        <br>• Are there any methods you use that help you learn your students' names? 
        <br>• If there was an app on your mobile device that assisted you in learning your student’s names, what features would be helpful?
        </p>

      <section class="case">
        <p class="title-helper">Step 3</p>
        <h2>Analyzing the Feedback</h2>
        <p>Reading through the survey responses introduced some really interesting insights or takeaways that would have been extremely difficult to foresee had I relied on my own assumptions.</p>
        <p class="insight-helper">Insight #1</p>
        <p>Most of those surveyed feel that learning their student’s names isn’t that difficult. To somewhat contradict this, most of them also said it takes nearly four weeks to learn their student’s names, and even then they admitted that after four weeks there may be a couple of names they continue to struggle with. This information helps set a baseline, which can be useful to gauge the effectiveness of the product.</p>
        <p class="insight-helper">Insight #2</p>
        <p>Those who teach middle school or high school tend to have more excitement for a solution to this problem. I assumed this is due to the fact that these teachers have far more students and far less time to learn their names. They may have up to seven classes a day compared to the one an elementary teacher sees, not to mention they get new students at the start of each semester. This information helps inform me of who the target user is, I may get more engagement putting more focus on a specific persona.</p>
        <p class="insight-helper">Insight #3</p>
        <p>For the survey, I made some assumptions about what types of activities the educators might utilize. I listed activities like matching games, daily quizzes, flash cards, or memorization techniques. Of those surveyed, they all agreed that these types of activities could be helpful and enjoyable. The purpose of this was to validate my assumptions for what direction to head as far as features and functionality are concerned. Including these in the experience should bring the necessary engagement in order to achieve the outcome I’m looking for.</p>
        <p class="insight-helper">Insight #4</p>
        <p>Every educator surveyed strongly agreed that the quicker they learn a student’s name, the better the teaching environment and the quicker they see their students learn, grow, and improve. Hearing these types of things is extremely motivational for me. Knowing that I can have an impact in someone’s life by designing a solution to a problem they are facing is one of the biggest reasons I love being a designer.</p>

        <p class="title-helper">Step 4</p>
        <h2>Designing the experience</h2>
        <p>At this point, I like to create a map of the user’s journey from start to finish. It starts with the problem and ends with the goals I defined earlier. After collecting data from users I should have a better idea of what the middle of the journey will look like. It may not be perfect but having something allows me to test and iterate more quickly. The visual nature of a journey map also makes communicating the ideas to someone else simpler.</p>
        <p>Getting user feedback on the journey map can reveal gaps in the experience I may have over-looked and also tell me whether or not I’m on the correct path without getting too far into specifics.</p>

      <section class="case">
        <p>Next, I started conceptualizing what the UI might look like by sketching ideas and then wireframing. Rough sketches allow me to get a lot of ideas out quickly without getting too attached.</p>

        <p class="title-helper">Step 5</p>
        <h2>Pixel Pushin'</h2>
        <p>Not long into sketching, I realized I had some good ideas and quickly jumped into digitizing them. For the sake of this exercise, I chose to focus on three specific views in the experience: 1) the list of names a user is trying to remember, 2) the challenges a user takes on to improve, and 3) a screen from one of those challenges.</p>

          <p>Here a user could add, browse, or edit students as well as their classes. Tapping a student's name would take a user to that student's profile. The percentages and checkmarks represent the user's accuracy for identifying each student during Challenges (see view #2). The software would train itself which students the user needs to work on for a more catered experience in Challenges. It would also help avoid testing the user on names they are already comfortable with.</p>

          <p>Challenges provide users with activities, tips, and lessons for improving. There are three Challenge groups based on difficulty. "Simple Flash Cards" is a slideshow of all their students as a way to get started. "Matching Against the Clock" is a timed multiple choice activity and "Moment of Truth" is the ultimate challenge where the user identifies each photo by typing in that student's name.</p>

          <p class="insight-helper">View #3</p>
          <p>This shows what the "Matching Against the Clock" challenge might look like. A student photo is displayed with a timing arc of 15 seconds that gradually fills up. The user must select the correct name in that duration. In order to advance to "The Moment of Truth," a user should be able to complete this challenge with 100% accuracy.</p>

        <h2>Learn, iterate, build, repeat</h2>
        <p>Lastly (it’s really only beginning), I’d build out a prototype to test the flows and validate the initial design with users. <a href="https://goo.gl/ZIhwwD" class="link" target="_blank"><strong>View the prototype I started for this exercise here.</strong></a> Based on the feedback I receive, I may need to go back and make some changes and even retest the new variation. Once I feel confident we’d start building.</p>
        <p>This is the first time I’m mentioning developers but in a typical project, they’d be involved every step of the way. I believe the designer/developer relationship is vital in making a successful product. I am always trying to familiarize myself with the tech stack we use for each project in order to empathize with those building the software and to better understand limitations. A solid relationship between designer and developer also allows me to ensure quality and polish up the experience before it goes out the door. But as the adage goes, “Done is better than perfect.” I have a pretty strong bias towards shipping. The faster I can get designs in more user’s hands the faster I can start to learn how to make the experience more usable, useful and delightful for them. </p>
